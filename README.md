# CS465-FullStack
CS 465- Full Stack Development 1 w/ MEAN

Architecture

This project utilized the handlebars framework, providing templates for the HTML pages so that there was a quick and noticeable progession from just starting out to getting a website up and running. The SPA (single page application) was created with Angular and since there isn't a back and forth from user to database, like there is with MPA's (multiple page applications), as the website is navigated it benefited from being outfitted with a noSQL database. That kind of database is best pairted with unstructured documents.

Functionality

JSON (javascript object notation) is beneficial for front and back end because it is easy to read for both parties as well as the machine itself, and on top of all that since the majority of the data will be converted to JSON there is an added layer of cohesiveness to the project. 
I took some of the components made for the SPA, like the nav bar or trip cards, from among the features previously made which improved the overall funcitonality and efficiency of the project. Refactoring those components and reusing the user interface components added a lot of versatility to the growth and performance of the project; information could be broken down and reused elsewhere as needed which harkens back to base principles of OOP (object oriented programming) like compartmentalizing.

Testing

A lot of the testing revolved around testing the api endpoints using a third party service, and the added verification security measures required users to be verified to use the system. This added a layer of time to the testing process as the security needed to be verified as working correctly as well.

Reflection

I learned a lot in this course and hadn't used a lot of the skills utilized here in such a flowing manner, it felt like guided meditation and just like meditation I know that I will need to revisit some of this in the future if I am going to be an effecient full stack, front end, or back end engineer.
I would have to say that this is one of the courses that has given me the most perspective of what a career in software developement could look like in the future and that will stick with me. I learned a lot about working with git and commenting on momentous changes made while working with code; I think the most marketable skill I have garnered is some experience with the MEAN stack (mongo, express, node, angular). I would be remiss if I attended an interview and didn't have some basic function or structure knowledge on the full stack.
